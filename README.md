# Teen-driven inquiry and working in the open

This project is focused on adapting and modifying [Mozilla's Open Leadership Training Series](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/) (OLT) for a teen audience, specifically so that teens will be better equipped to launch and carry out collaborative inquiry projects and work in the open.

## Getting Started

We're working mostly in google docs for editing/commenting on current OLT content  (insert link to GDoc/drive)
