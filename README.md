# Teen-driven inquiry and working in the open

This project is focused on adapting and modifying [Mozilla's Open Leadership Training Series](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/) (OLT) for a teen audience, specifically so that teens will be better equipped to launch and carry out collaborative inquiry projects and work in the open. Our primary focus is projects that don't involve much (if any) code. For more information see the [open canvas for this project](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WOT9X4JIWRVvhesGsMLRdRCA1VVRkAnsTs1XvCM07sU/edit?usp=sharing). 

## Getting Started

We're working mostly in google docs for editing/commenting on current OLT content. [Here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4_58xQkngljYnhfOUZ2dUludUk) is the google drive folder where we're working
